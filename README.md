# CS50
These are the programming assignments that I completed throughout the CS50 course offered by Harvard. Each program's description and specifications can be found below.

# Problem Set 0 (Scratch):
scratch.sb3 - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/0/scratch/<br />
An introduction to programming concepts.<br />

# Problem Set 1 (C):
hello.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/hello/<br />
A simple hello world program in C.<br />
mario.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/mario/more/<br />
A program that prints a Mario flagpole tower at a height inputted by the user.<br />
credit.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/credit/<br />
A program that analyses a credit card number and tells the user if it is MasterCard, Visa, American Express, or invalid. Makes use of the Luhn Algorithm.<br />

# Problem Set 2 (C):
readability.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/readability/<br />
This program analyses some user-inputted text and outputs the grade level that the text is at in terms of difficulty to read, doing so by calculating the Coleman-Liau index of the text.<br />
substitution.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/2/substitution/<br />
A program that encrypts a phrase according to a 26-letter key, where the key and the text is user-inputted.<br />

# Problem Set 3 (C):
plurality.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/plurality/<br />
A program that takes votes of different candidates in a simple election from a user, and outputs the winner.<br />
tideman.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/3/tideman/<br />
A program where the user inputs different voter's rankings of election candidates and outputs the winner based on a ranked-style election's rules.<br />

# Problem Set 4 (C):
filter - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/filter/more/<br />
recover.c - https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/4/recover/<br />
